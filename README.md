# Hello, World! ðŸ‘‹ I'm 0xHepha

I am a passionate technologist, currently diving deep into the world of blockchain and its potential to redefine industries. With a solid background in in web development and automation services, I am now focused on building and learning blockchain technologies to foster innovation and drive real-world solutions.

## ðŸ”­ Current Projects

I'm currently working on:
- A custom made blokchain explorer focused on various user types interfaces. Base intial demo: [ArgusNet]([https://argusnet.hephastudios.com](https://argusnet.hephastudios.com))
- Exploring the creation and execution of smart-contracts using pure OP codes

## ðŸŒ± Learning Goals

- Mastering Solidity for creating secure and efficient smart contracts.
- Delving into the different blockchain platforms and understanding their unique advantages.

## ðŸ‘¯ Community

I believe in the power of community and collaboration. Reach out if you'd like to exchange ideas or work on blockchain projects together.

## âœ¨ Fun Rollercoaster Journey

- **Discovery**: "Hmm, what should I do? I like computers... let's give this system and network administration course a shot!"
- **Twist of Fate**: "Wait, what? I learned system management, why am I at a programming company?"
- **Unexpected Offer**: "It's a mistake, but they offer guidance in self-learning to code rather than sending me back. No other options, let's dive in!"
- **Surprise Enjoyment**: "Wow, this is fun! I'm going for a course in web development."
- **Internship Excitement**: "Can't wait for the internship, armed with coding skills this time!"
- **Deja Vu**: "Hold on, why am I in the backup management department again?"
- **First Dev Task**: "Finally, a dev task! Adding a small web interface to launch scripts."
- **Rapid Escalation**: "That escalated quickly... now I have a whole web app managing the backup servers!"
- **Unexpected Assignment**: "A new department of automation? Never touched this tool before, yet here I am!"
- **Automation Wins**: "Server automation is yielding insane results, delivery time drastically reduced!"
- **Craving Challenge**: "It's getting mundane, too easy... Should I chase a degree for a challenge?"
- **Academic Adventure**: "Intriguing topics but why memorize when we can code? Shouldn't we create libraries instead of memorizing them?"
- **Boredom Strikes**: "The repetition, the memorization, everyone learning the same thing but no one to answer my unique questions..."
- **Blockchain Beckons**: "What's this blockchain magic? Hmm, this course teaches the basics..."
- **Newfound Excitement**: "Blockchain is exhilarating! Time to build some projects."

  To be continued...
